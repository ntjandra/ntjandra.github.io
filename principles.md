### Tenets (unless you know better ones)

This is an activity I picked up from working at Amazon. These are my work-life guidelines that I use to determine priorities and balance passion with results.

1. **Plan not Schedule**: My #1 way to avoid over-stress and burn-out. Plan, think, and do it when you have time, not forcing a specific block.
2. **Selective Mimicry**: Start from a template. Train on the best then add your own unique flair to truly make it yours.
3. **Epistomology.** The study of learning. By understanding how I learn best, I can learn faster with less overhead.
4. **V Shaped Skillset**: I write as well as I code. Firm belief that technical and non-technical skills should be 1:1 balanced. 
5. **Crop Rotation**: Farming the same thing on soil leads to devastation. To avoid this rotate tasks and try new things.
