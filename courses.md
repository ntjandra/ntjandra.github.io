# My Coursework as an Undergrad
As part of my Degree in Computer Science I focused on courses that teach Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Software Engineering.

### CMPS 140: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Capstone)
In this course, AI teaches Pac-Man how to win.
1. General Search using Heuristics: Pac-Man Trapped in a Maze
2. Adversarial Search: Pac-Man V.S Ghosts
3. Reinforcement Learning: Pac-Man "Capture the Flag" Contest

### CMPM 146: Game AI 
In this course, I applied my knowledge of algorithms and math to create AI solutions to problems.
1. Adversarial Search: Space Wars, AI manages a fleet to takeover the galaxy.
2. Procedural Content Generation: Super Mario Brothers Level Generator.
<!-- Built using Python and the Unity Game Engine --> 
3. Decision Trees: Enemy AI codename Boo M-AI-TES for the Boo Mates game
<!-- Built using C++ and the Unity Game Engine -->

### CMPS 144: Applied Machine Learning (Capstone)
1. Made a LSTM Neural Network from scratch that identified reuters articles.
2. Trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify articles of clothing based on images.
3. Preproccessed numerical, catagorical, and ordinal data to develop models for airport flight simulation.

### CMPS 115A: Software Development Project (Capstone)
1. Created an e-commerce website called RentMyJunk.
2. Performed the duties of a Product Owner and Scrum Master.
2. Develop a website that connects users to rent out goods to others, and then choose to purchase, continue renting, or return it.
3. Implemented a post system for users to see item posts and a reputation system to keep bad actors out.
