# Projects & Experiences
Experiences and summaries with links to see more.

## Present

I'm currently on the job-market. I offer services on a contract or hire basis. See my [services](hire-me.md) if you're interested in a small project (Open Source Only) or connect with me on LinkedIn to refer me.

## Highlight

### Amazon (Core AI)
I worked at Amazon as a Technical Writer, but I did so much more than simply write. My primary focus is towards developing team and organization mechanisms for economists, engineers, and scientists. I created all forms of content: Wikis, Broadcast Videos, API documentation, Runbooks, PR/FAQs, and even presented online workshops. I'm especially proud of the scope of impact in my work.
