# My Projects

## Here are some projects in my area of interest.

## Software Engineering & Project Management
In these projects I worked with a small team of 4 to develop full stack applications.
There's so much to say about these projects, that I've dedicated a page for each of them.

### SEADS Vault: Outage Detection Software for voltage analysis and electrical hazard prevention. [see more]({% link _projects/SE-1.md %})

### SuppCheck: Healthy eating mobile application that provides insight into the health benefits of fitness supplements.

### RentMyJunk: Website that aims at reducing waste through renting used goods.

## Artificial General Intelligence
AI courses I took during my time as an undergrad and genuinely enjoyed (and would recommend to others)!
### CMPS 140: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Capstone)
1. General Search using Heuristics - A*
2. Adversarial Search - MinMax, Expectimax
3. Reinforcement Learning - Pac Man Contest

### CMPM 146: Game AI 
1. A* Again, but with a navmesh
2. Adversarial Search - Space Wars 
3. Procedural Content Generation - SMB AI Level Generator (Unity)
4. Boo M-AI-TES - Developed Enemy AI for a Party Game in Beta (Unity)

### CMPS 144: Applied Machine Learning (Capstone)
1. Made a LSTM Neural Network from scratch that identified reuters articles.
2. Trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify articles of clothing.
3. Preproccessed numerical, catagorical, and ordinal data to develop models for airplane fights.
