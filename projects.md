I'm a curious and practical technical writer with 4 years of experience saving developers time by shipping docs and code. I'm especially proud of leaving a large impact. I work for clients and employers on a contract or hire basis.

- Rose Mage to the top of Google Search with featured snippets, building an SEO content strategy of edutainment.
- Reduced Amazon customer tickets filled by 90% by writing docs to free up engineer and scientist resources on-call.
- Detect and maintain documentation and learning paths for the Azure Kubernetes Service at Microsoft using AI and SEO metrics.

<!-- ## Highlight

### Amazon (Core AI)

I worked at Amazon as a Technical Writer, but I did so much more than simply write. My primary focus is towards developing team and organization mechanisms for economists, engineers, and scientists. I created all forms of content: Wikis, Broadcast Videos, API documentation, Runbooks, PR/FAQs, and even presented online workshops. I'm especially proud of the scope of impact in my work.
