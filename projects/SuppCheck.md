# Backend Software Engineer for SuppCheck

A _mobile_ _application_ to look up ingredients of various fitness supplements and products. Developed during CruzHacks 2020.

SuppCheck was founded on January 17, as a 48 hour [hackathon project](https://devpost.com/software/suppcheck-pvgnz0)
It is designed as a iOS and Android application for analyzing fitness supplements that go into your body.

The application functions by capturing an image of the ingredients from a product label.

### Then it searches the ingredients to identify 
- Chemical Compounds
- Organic ingredients

### Our team plans to add additional features for 
- Alergens
- Dieting
- User Accounts

## Result: At CruzHacks SuppCheck won two awards
- **Second Place** in **Health Hack** category

- **Runner-up** for **Best Use of Google Cloud**

# After the Hackathon

## We were invited by SCWorks to present our application

We applied to the Monterey Bay Startup Challenge to bring this idea to the next level, seeking funding, investments, and financial advisors.
Unfortunately we weren't able to secure funding and halted production in March 2020.

## Future
As of June 19, 2020 we slowly picked this back up as a hobby to bring it back as a mobile app.
