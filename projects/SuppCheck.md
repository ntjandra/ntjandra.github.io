# Backend Software Engineer for SuppCheck

A _mobile_ _application_ to look up ingredients of various fitness supplements and products. Developed during CruzHacks 2020.

SuppCheck was founded on January 17, as a 48 hour [hackathon project](https://devpost.com/software/suppcheck-pvgnz0)
It is designed as a iOS and Android application for analyzing fitness supplements that go into your body.

The application functions by capturing an image of the ingredients from a product label and then checking which are healthy and which are not. It is configured to support 30,000 different chemical compounds and detect errors in the image processing layer.

## How it works

### Searches the label to identify 
- Chemical Compounds
- Organic ingredients

### Queries for benefit data of chemicals and determine their purpose in the supplement
Examples
- Ingredient is healthy for the heart and treatment of ...
- Ingredient is known to cause diabetes or cancer and increase risk of ...

### Our team plans to add additional features for 
- Alergens
- Dieting
- User Accounts

# After the Hackathon

## We were invited by SCWorks to present our application

We applied to the Monterey Bay Startup Challenge to bring this idea to the next level, seeking funding, investments, and financial advisors.
Unfortunately we weren't able to secure funding and halted production on March 2020 to focus more on our studies.

## Future
As of June 19, 2020 we slowly picked this back up as a hobby to bring it back as a mobile app.
