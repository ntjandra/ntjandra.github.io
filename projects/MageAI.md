## Mage

Mage is a growing start-up company that went through many transisitons during it's time to establish an identity. I was hired as the first technical writer and expanded from writing posts to also managing outsourced writers, hiring and assembling the full-time writing team, and owning a part of Mage Academy, a platform to learn machine learning.

### Posts

Posts were intended for technical and non-technical audiences, but had a marketing and educational aspect of it.

- Posted everything in my [Medium](https://medium.com/@tjandranathaniel) in the Mage Publication.
- Guest Post on [Simple Programmer](https://simpleprogrammer.com/integrate-your-work-life-balance/)
- Guest Post on [The AI Journal](https://aijourn.com/the-future-of-programming-low-code-ai-tools/).

### Documentation

I wrote API documentation for functions, sample dataset labels, and third-party integrations. You'll find these docs at https://docs.mage.ai/. I do want to stress that this site changes over time and what's on it at the time you look at it is not fully my work.

I owned scripts and recording, but for some I also presented videos on datasource integrations with Mage. Available on YouTube. See most video before "Mager Transformation".

There were more videos in the past, but Mage no longer supports those features (Snowflake, and others datasources), so they were taken down.

### Events

I presented at TreeHacks 2020 to do a livestream of the Mage API/Website demo and answer questions. Mage was a Hackathon challenge sponsor and had their own category with cash prizes.s
