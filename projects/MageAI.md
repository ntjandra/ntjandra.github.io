## Mage

Mage is a growing AI start-up company that went through many transitions during it's time to establish an identity, direction and brand. I was hired as the first technical writer and expanded their content outreach and strategy for technical audiences primarily focusing on those that code. From writing posts to also managing writers I was involved with project management. After my promotion, I moved on to hire and assemble the full-time writing team. This team would later become the DevRel/Documentation team where I shifted focus to growing our community and developing Mage Academy, a platform to learn machine learning.

## Content Strategy

### Posts

Posts were intended for technical and non-technical audiences, but had a marketing and educational aspect of it.

- Posted Mage focused articles in my [Medium](https://medium.com/@tjandranathaniel) in the Mage Publication.
- Guest Post on [Simple Programmer](https://simpleprogrammer.com/integrate-your-work-life-balance/)
- Guest Post on [The AI Journal](https://aijourn.com/the-future-of-programming-low-code-ai-tools/).

### Documentation

I wrote API documentation for functions, sample dataset labels, and third-party integrations. You'll find these docs at https://docs.mage.ai/. I do want to stress that this site changes over time and what's on it at the time you look at it is not fully my work.

I owned scripts and recording, but for some I also presented videos on datasource integrations with Mage. Available on YouTube. See most video before "Mager Transformation".

There were more videos in the past, but Mage no longer supports those features (Snowflake, and others datasources), so they were taken down.

### Events

I presented at TreeHacks 2020 to do a livestream of the Mage API/Website demo and answer questions. Mage was a Hackathon challenge sponsor and had their own category with cash prizes. During the presentation, I walked through end-to-end how to transform data and (re)train a machine learning model with Mage to optimize it for a given use case. I wrapped up by answering questions from the audience and explaining our Hackathon challenge and prizes.
