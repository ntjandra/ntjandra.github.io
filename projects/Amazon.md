## Out-of-scope
Honorable mention of "volunteer" work with lower priority, but good for learning and career paths as a Technical Evangelist/Developer Advocate. Often intiated by a skip-level manager or Amazonian that found what I did amazing. I put these here as they are less writing focused or less technical.

- Wiki Metrics Dashboard: Create a dashboard to track teams and roles visiting wiki pages.
- Enagagement Mechanisms: Gauge interest through a badge/award system for early access contributors.
- Community Development Initiative: Foster talent with a wiki for economist programs.
- Team Workshops and Training: Requested by skip-level manager to present a workshop during our Bi-weekly knowledge sharing. I taught SEO best practices, tenets, and how to use VSCode with Git.
- Broadcast Videos: Budget videos with voice-over, screen capture, and light edits.

## Learnings

### Project management
Learned about WIP Limits, and the minor and major differences between each form of Agile Methodology.

### Culture

My Top Leadership Principls: Deliver Results, Earn Trust, Bias for Action.


### Technical
Working as a technical writer on AWS Infrastructure taught me a lot about the sheer number of public facing and internal services for cloud computing. I also learned about Spark (Distributed Systems) and state of the art ML research algorithms (confidential).


## Testimonials 

After learning about the importance of networking and feedback, I developed a feedback form to maintain the connection between my peers and got back some amazing testimonials that speak for themselves.

### Scientists

"Nathaniel, you are the first technical writer I met in the company and you did a great job understanding the content of several projects and putting them into nice wiki pages. Thanks for your great work!" - Applied Scientist at Amazon

### Engineers

"Nathaniel allowed me to focus on technical development, while being assured that the documentation piece would be well-handled." - Data Engineer at Amazon

"Nathanielâ€™s work was always well-polished, and he always was clear about defining requirements." - Principal Data Engineer at Amazon

"You always bring great energy and are fearless and proactive in learning new things. Your presence on the team will be missed." - Software Development Engineer at Amazon

### Managers

"Nathaniel was excellent to work with. He was organized, his deliverables were bar raising and he was able to complete the project with minimal oversight. He proposed creative ideas to improve the Core AI Intake process, which we adopted." - Sr. Product Manager at Amazon

"I am impressed on how you streamline our quip to wiki publish process, and all the well polished wiki / guides / posters you wrote." - Technical Product Management at Amazon

"Nathaniel went above and beyond: really excellent work on the above tasks, and especially helping us define our tenets! - Sr. Research Manager, Core AI (economist and engineering team) at Amazon

## What I will miss

The People. The Resources. The Projects.

### The bar of people
Amazon (Core AI) has shown me just how big the world really is. A tech giant that's able to hire and retain the best through not just an emphasis on monetary compensation, but work-life balance and fostering a suportive, kind, space for learning. Our VPs won a nobel prize and the org has former prize winners. It's astounding to think about their credentials and qualifications! I truly appreciate their patience when they were explaining (confidential algorithm).

### The plentiful resources
Amazon has a strong writing culture, which has led to their content on wikis and broadcast to be truly amazing. I spent countless time learning about work-related AWS Style Guides, Engineer Onboarding, and Amazon All-Hands. On top of that, the sheet number of people led to there being mental-health content for those days with writer's block. My favorite (non-technical) learnings were on Imposter Syndrome, Choronotypes, and 2 Way Decision Making.

### The fascinating projects
I love learning about the ML projects and detailed Data engineering with Spark and Kafka. I'm excited to see where the project leads. Each project felt unique in some way and the org has a good culture about building with legos rather than reinventing the wheel. My favorite part was when I got to document an alpha stage product as it itterated over and grew exponentially in terms of interest.
