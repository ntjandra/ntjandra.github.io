title:  "Hire Me"

I'm opening a new service where I use my experience to improve my public portfolio. I plan on starting by accepting small jobs related to technical writing that can be done within a single sprint. I currently don't plan on accepting monetary payments since it's more of a hobby than a business.

## Why did I start a service
As I apply to jobs I realize I don't have many public work samples, both due to NDAs from working at research labs and big tech. This results in "free-work" take-home assignments. When I do take-home assignments, it feels the same where I end up writing something they'll publish. So, instead of working for free to get a job, I'd much rather give them a trial and possibly get converted. It hurts even more when you spend time on a take home that is basically an unfinished company task. It hurts when I don't land the job, it leaves me feeling exploited and it doesn't sit well with me. This is especially common when I apply to startups. 

## Limited Time Offer
As a trial and incentive for early clients, I'm willing to waive any monetary payments. At minimum, all I ask is for an account with access so I can try the product out and write content for it. 

### Paid in exposure and usage
In terms of payment, if you choose to use my writing, please upgrade me to a premium version of the software/product that I can use for commercial purposes. If you'd like to hire me after, I'd love to open up the floor to job opportunities, connection requests, or be a work reference.

### Investment
Looking at it this way, it's similar to how artists and other creative jobs take commissions rather than hourly salaries. Artists start off with small comissions and grow to a portfolio to showcase their range of art styles. For me, I am investing in not taking monetary payments to grow my professional portfolio when I apply to jobs.

## Technical Writing Services
My skills are best suited to specialize in providing high-quality technical writing and content creation services that help our clients clearly communicate complex technical information related to software and code.

My services include:

### Documentation
My time at Amazon has developed my expertise to create clear, concise, and informative documentation for technical products and services. I've written plenty of internal user manuals to technical guides, software documentation to API references. The leadership principles I embody in my writing to create documentation that is accurate, readable, and usable.

### Online Help and Support
I've written support articles for internal engineering staff dealing with external customers. I'll help you create online help and support resources that enable your users and staff to quickly find the information they need to answer tickets. I follow best practices to develop help articles, FAQs, and knowledge bases that are organized, easy to search through, and designed to provide quick and accurate answers to your users' questions by cutting out the fluff.

### Editing and Proofreading
I refine your technical content using my skills in SEO, English, and software engineering. For these tasks, I focus on accuracy, readability, and visual appeal to clean up your existing content, improve structure and flow, and fix errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation. I support technical SEO efforts and provide advice on how you can leverage your engineering teams to impact past software development.

## Basic Writing Services
While my skills are best suited for heavy technical content with a technical audience. I'm able to write for non-technical audiences that involve minimal code and theory. I've had the opportunity to work for clients to take on jobs that involve the following:

### Blogs
I post blogs on Medium and write articles for users that are educational and entertain the readers. I've written blogs for startups and guest posted in various sites to improve SEO of websites, and find joy in sharing my knowledge. Blogs are either technical or non-technical depending on the client and audience. I find it more important to follow blog posting guidelines to keep a good reputation rather than satisfy the exact metrics and levers that breaks guidelines.

### Whitepapers
White papers explain complex technical concepts to your target audience in an easy-to-understand and engaging manner.I'll spend time to research, design and write whitepapers with a persuasive writing style to showcase your company niches, expertise, and leadership in your industry. 

### Case Studies
Our team of experienced writers can help you create case studies that highlight your technical capabilities and demonstrate your ability to solve complex problems for your clients. Case studies are an effective way to showcase your ability to deliver results and establish credibility with your target audience.

## Agreement
I'm committed to delivering high-quality technical writing services to clients to help grow my career. Depending on what we speak about, it can be over text, a call to discuss the project, and finalize the objective. We'll have a brief chat about the uses of your product, and availability of resources to assist with the review of deliverables.
