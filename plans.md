# Site Release Logs

Modular code is clean code. I've made updates to improve my pace of future updates by cleaning up the beginner way I've been using Jekyll. It took a while, but now I know how to import frontmatter from other pages and extract information outside of the _data folder. I've put to the test my fluency in CSS styling and web development during my pastime. I'll continue to work on this whenever there's breaks from work like today (President's Day). I'm excited to work more on this site and it's been a great way to wind down.
