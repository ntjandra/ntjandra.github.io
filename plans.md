# Site Plans
It's been a while since I last touched this website. I've learned a lot more about styling and web development during the time I've been away. Over the next couple months I'm working to improve this site and have some planned features.

## Planned Features
- [ ] Blog for personal use
- [ ] Improved Styling
- [ ] Calendar/Quick Contact
- [ ] Clean up source code

## Out of Date
- [ ] Update Resume and LaTex Download.
- [ ] Projects Page
- [ ] SeadsVault (RREES Company) Change to Professional Experience
- [ ] Add more about Tech Stack used and my specific impact.
