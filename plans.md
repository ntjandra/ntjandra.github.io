# Site Release Logs
It's been a while since I last touched this website. I've learned a lot more about styling and web development during the time I've been away. Over the next couple months I'm working to improve this site and have some planned features. 

After being on the job search again, I've got more freetime to update my blog. I like to spend my time coding and writing so I'll improve my UI and post more blogs. **Past site updates: [Site Change Log](/archive.html)**
