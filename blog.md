title: Deep Thoughts of Learning
---

I'm a man of few spoken words, but I love to write or have a meaningful discussion. Welcome to my blog called deep thoughts of learning, a place where I go to organize my thoughts and recharge my energy. Here you'll learn more about my personality, values, and passion. I hope to have time to create semi-daily blog posts and push updates here weekly or biweekly.
