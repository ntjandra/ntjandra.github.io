Welcome to my blog, a place where I go to organize my thoughts and recharge my energy as an introvert. 

Here I share topics related to my personality, values, and passion, alongside 100% true memoirs. I try to cover topics relevant to my goals, experience, and any blog updates. To learn more about the inspiration for the topics in this blog, visit [here](./2021/10/24/a-new-brand.html).
