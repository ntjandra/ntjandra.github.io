Welcome to my blog, a place where I go to organize my thoughts and recharge. This blog is where you can learn more about me, not my resume. I cover topics related to my personality, values, and passion alongside 100% true memoirs. To learn more about the inspiration for the blog, visit [here](./2021/10/24/a-new-brand.html).
