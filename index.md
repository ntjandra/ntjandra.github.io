# Welcome to my personal space
I first started this page shortly after graduation on June 16, 2020. 
Due to shelter in place I had a lot of spare time and wanted to make something.
I created this place as a great way for employers to know about me and start off conversations.

### This website is
- A place for employers and collegues to see my skills/real world applications, outside of coding challenges.
- A history I will be proud to look back on, whether it was a landing my first paid job or a not-so-sucessful startup idea.
- More detail besides the one page resume, I'm energetic and it's difficult to put everything in one page.
- Eventualy a website I can update more often and add some cool features outside of traditional "blogs". Live2D looks good...

### Work-life Balance
1. This website was created to be a portfolio, but that doesn't mean it has to be 100% formal.
2. I really want visitors to know my hobbies and what I enjoy doing during my spare time.
3. I needed a way to tell people what times I am free as an all in one scheduler.
