## Welcome to Nathaniel's Website

Hey there, welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Nathaniel, and I'm all about how to write, code, and learn. Whether you're a potential client, employer, or just curious about what I do, this site caters to you. Feel free to take a look around to get to know me better. 

For information on my technical skills, I've put together a collection of my experiences in Research, Engineering, and Technical Writing for you to check out in [projects](projects).

But, if you'd like to know more about me and who I am as a person in 3D, then read my personal [blog](/blog.md) which doubles as my memoir.

If you don't have much time to look through the site that's okay. I've condensed my information in the [about](about.md) section.

### Tenets (unless you know better ones)

This is an activity I picked up from working at Amazon. These are my work-life guidelines that I use to determine priorities and balance passion with results.

1. **Plan not Schedule**: My #1 way to avoid over-stress and burn-out. Plan, think, and do it when you have time, not forcing a specific block.
2. **Selective Mimicry**: Start from a template. Train on the best then add your own unique flair to truly make it yours.
3. **Epistomology.** The study of learning. By understanding how I learn best, I can learn faster with less overhead.
4. **V Shaped Skillset**: I write as well as I code. Firm belief that technical and non-technical skills should be 1:1 balanced. 
5. **Crop Rotation**: Farming the same thing on soil leads to devastation. To avoid this rotate tasks and try new things.

 Thanks for visiting, since you've made it this far, I'd love to connect with you on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaniel-tjandra/) afterwards!
