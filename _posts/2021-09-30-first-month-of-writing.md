The month was brutal but rewarding and fun. I got the meet the team in person and we hit it off pretty well. The future looks bright as "we ride the rocketship". To follow up with my last post I was only able to release three articles, but am planned to release six within the next month, along with two guest posts.

### Reassurance

We met with one of our stakeholders and sponsors, and he was surprised to hear I am a rookie writer (less than a year experience). He said I wrote well and the articles were all high quality. That made my day and inpsired me to really push my limits and hit our mark. Our CEO told us that if we aim for 100% and we hit it, we aren't trying hard enough. Truly a rocket ship experience. I trust him as he's skilled and he got it from hard work and dedication by following mottos like that.

### Future of blog

As I said prior, I would slow down releases for this blog, but I didn't expect to miss two weeks. I appologize for all the readers and will set high goals for next month. Let's go with 2 a week, one on wednesday and one on another day.

### Work Schedule

Next month we're putting in tons of time. I feel that to hit my goal of six articles, I'll need to work on Saturday which I don't mind as long as I can stay healthy and can pursue what I love to do. I'd like to touch base on coding more, visit topics regarding production and deployment, as well as become a better artist or photoshopper.

### Improvements

I am enjoying creating automations and having a supportive manager that plays for the team. Together we'll incorporate technology in our workplace to assess goals and content management (project management for content creators). 

## Next Big Thing?

My upcoming article introduces more about what I do and the goals I'm aiming for as a technical writer. It'll be a great read that further supports what we believe in. I can't say too much until it's out though.
