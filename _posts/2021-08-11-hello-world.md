I finally set up the groundwork for a blog. It was not as easy as I thought it would be as I got distracted by many additional features. I had to reinvent some styling, and play around with the overall organization of files. Hello World is an intro post I created by following this [tutorial](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-static-site-building-with-jekyll/add-a-post?u=65318132).

## Page Credits
This website was made possible by the layouts of Lanyon, Poole, and Athena. I Frankenstein them together to make this vibrant page using their layouts for specific components such as the sidebar and paragraph styles. Integration is the hardest part of making this, which is why it took me much so longer than I had planned.

### Resources: LinkedIn Learning
Developing this page was a lot easier thanks to LinkedIn Learning. I'm grateful to the University of California for offering staff and students a LinkedIn Learning subscription until August 2022. I look forward to improving my skills through this as I continue my job hunt and finish off that bucket list.

## Next Blog-Related Features
For the future, I plan to improve the blog experience by adding category tags and a search bar with filters by tags. Currently, there are some bugs with the previous buttons and content. Then I'll need to customize a new post layout rather than the current Athena theme by adding Card components.
