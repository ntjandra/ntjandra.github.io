November approaches Thanksgiving, and I'm thankful for many things. This week I'll write about how I'm thankful for friends.

## School Friends
I was the quiet one at school, so I didn't have many friends and cherished them when I could. My most memorable and consistent friend group is my 5 high school friends. Some I knew from elementary, some from middle school. I transfered schools a lot as a kid, always had to move due to legal reasons/school districts. Now, I play various games with them and this week we played Among Us. 

### Among Us
There was a big update that got us back into it recently. I was really impressed by how they did a great job balancing their "battle pass", it didn't take too long to unlock everything and it wasn't a paid only feature. It shows the company cares about the community and is not looking for a cash cow.

## Online Friends
Today, I'm excited to spend time with a group of online friends I've known for six years. It started off from me meeting them in High School in a game called League of Legends. I could go on endlessly about "THe Black Hole" of LoL, but tldr, we were bad at the game. Some got better, and some got more casual. I became a casual ARAMer who plays for first-win bonus. Other's hit Diamond, but we don't talk as much anymore. 

### ARCANE
So why does this matter? Well it's because today I'm going to be watching Arcane with them, a show about League of Legends characters, which started the whole friendship off. Haven't seen trailers or anything but I've heard positive reviews on it so we're going to binge watch the series. It's ongoing so it's not like binging One Piece.

## Childhood friends
Around Thanksgiving I'm going to be meeting up with my childhood friends who I've kept in contact with since I was 5. We met through church and haven't separated since. We'll be visiting Disneyland holds a special place in my heart as that's where I go with all my closest friends and family.

### Edify
During the pandemic, lots of the church members left so it's been lonelier. Yesterday's sermon was good, it spoke about edifying yourself (aka growing), and that gave me the idea to write out today's post on reflection.

## Workplace friends
My most recent group of friends, are friends I met from work. It's not "an esteemed collegue" which is a passive way of saying you'd work with them, but wouldn't take them out to have fun. I consider my current coworkers all friends, we get together and while we have tasks and are busy, we all support each other and work to make everyone's day better. It's a positive company with positive vibes focusing on helping developers which is an even bigger plus.

## Just the good, not the bad
That ends my thankfulness post on friendship. Along the way, I made more fake friends who weren't commited + didn't care + disappeared. There's a person that tried to groom me, but we'll keep that story for another time. As I continue I'll (hopefully) make more friends, but keeping the closest friends close is satisfying enough for me. 

### Games?
One thing I've been wanting to do is create a game and this seems like a great starter theme. All I need now is a name. How about Frienemies: A social battle of deduction, betrayal, and loving kindness? Time to check if the name is taken. Looks like there's a Christian board game called "True Frenemies", but it's not similar to what I'm thinking so I should be fine. The last thing anyone wants is a copyright strike.
