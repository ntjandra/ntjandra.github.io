# About

### Intro
I first started this website shortly after graduation on June 16, 2020. 
Due to shelter in place I had a lot of spare time and wanted to make something.
I noticed as I was applying to jobs employers left a link to a portfolio website.
I created this place as a great way for employers to know about me and start off conversations.

### Purpose
- A place for employers and collegues to see my skills through real world applications, outside of coding challenges.
- A history I will be proud to look back on, whether it was a landing my first paid job or a not-so-sucessful startup idea.
- More detail besides the one page resume, I'm enthusiastic and it's difficult to put everything in one page.
- Eventualy a website I can update more often and add some cool features outside of traditional "blogs".

### I am a human, not a robot.
- This website was created to be a portfolio, but that doesn't mean it has to be 100% formal. 
- I'd like to form a connection with visitors by sharing my hobbies and what I enjoy doing during my spare time.
- As a Programmer, I code. As a Software Engineer, I design. As a Researcher, I look into trends and learn best through mimicry.
