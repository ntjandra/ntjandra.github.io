# About

### Intro
I first started this website shortly after graduation on June 16, 2020. 
Due to shelter in place I had a lot of spare time and wanted to make something.
I noticed as I was applying to jobs employers left a link to a portfolio website.
I created this place as a great way for employers to know about me and start off conversations.

### Website Uses
- A place for employers and collegues to see my skills/real world applications, outside of coding challenges.
- A history I will be proud to look back on, whether it was a landing my first paid job or a not-so-sucessful startup idea.
- More detail besides the one page resume, I'm enthusiastic and it's difficult to put everything in one page.
- Eventualy a website I can update more often and add some cool features outside of traditional "blogs".

### Work-life Balance
1. This website was created to be a portfolio, but that doesn't mean it has to be 100% formal.
2. I really want visitors to know my hobbies and what I enjoy doing during my spare time.
3. I needed a way to tell people what times I am free as an all in one scheduler.

### FAQ
1. Do you use Social Media?
    I use Discord to chat with friends and use LinkedIn for more professional conversations.
    I do not use other forms of social media due to being an invtrovert at a young age and a very bad experience.
    I had a Facebook and deactivated it in 7th Grade when my account got hacked. I never went back to FB or any clones, but I don't miss it since I never posted much. I mostly played games on it such as Backyard Monsters and Restaurant City.
    
2. What are your hobbies?
    I describe myself as an Otaku, Gamer, and Coder. 
    I love reading manga and webtoons and playing LoL, LoR, or anime gacha games.
    During this pandemic, I haven't done enough exercise but when it's over I am looking forward to trying something new that's more active.
    As for sports, I used to play Badminton for approximately 6 years.

3. Where are you based?
    I live with my parents in San Francisco and work remotely during the pandemic. I am not open to relocation outside of California.

4. What are your interests?
    Anything relating to "Cities of the Future" is a big interest of mine. 
    Some applications I've done are developing large scalable storage systems, connecting a wide network of users, to developing sustainable electrical devices. I really want a self-driving car!
