# About

### Intro
I first started this website shortly after graduation on June 16, 2020. 
Due to shelter in place I had a lot of spare time and wanted to make something.
I noticed as I was applying to jobs employers left a link to a portfolio website.
I created this place as a great way for employers to know about me and start off conversations.

### Purpose
- A place for employers and collegues to see my skills through real world applications, outside of coding challenges.
- A history I will be proud to look back on, whether it was a landing my first paid job or a not-so-sucessful startup idea.
- More detail besides the one page resume, I'm enthusiastic and it's difficult to put everything in one page.
- Eventualy a website I can update more often and add some cool features outside of traditional "blogs".

### I am a human, not a robot.
- This website was created to be a portfolio, but that doesn't mean it has to be 100% formal. 
- I'd like to form a connection with visitors by sharing my hobbies and what I enjoy doing during my spare time.
- As a Programmer, I code. As a Software Engineer, I design. As a Researcher, I look into trends and learn best through mimicry.

### FAQ
1. Do you use Social Media?  
    I use Discord to chat with friends and use LinkedIn or Slack for more professional conversations.

3. Where are you located?  
    I live with my parents in San Francisco. I am searching for work within California.

2. What are your hobbies?  
    I describe myself as your everday nerd. I spent most of my days indoors, but I enjoy going outdoors to camp with friends and family in Yosemite.
    I love reading manga and webtoons, especially stories about a second chance at life or being trapped inside a game.
    I play MOBAs, trading card games (TCGs), and Gacha games as a free-to-play. I enjoy saving up for events and grinding out games that will last a lifetime. Outside of online activities, I love to play tabletop games, such as Dungeon's and Dragons or board games.
    On Saturday, I go hiking with my mother and explore areas near San Francisco and Daly City, visiting areas filled with nice scenary and plenty of nature.
    As for sports, I 've played indoor Badminton for approximately 6 years. I'd be up play a singles match if anyone challenges me!

3. What do you do outside of work?
    During my freetime, when I'm alone I work on personal projects. Based on my love of the anime art style, gacha games, and hiking, I've been hard at work creating a Gacha Game that focuses on leveraging the GPS on mobile devices in order to construct an MMO focusing on visiting National Parks to clear dungeons. Other times, I write backstories for characters in DnD and develop worlds. I've created a Battle Royale themed campaign for one shot sessions for up to 16 players, inspired by Hunger Games: Catching Fire.

4. What are your interests?  
    Anything relating to "Cities of the Future" is a big interest of mine. In order to accomplish this goal I've been gaining experience with web development, databases/server management, Distributed Systems, and File I/O Systems. Applications I've worked on have focused around developing large scalable storage systems, notifying a wide network of users, and management of data collected from smart systems.

5. What are your thoughts on AI?  
   Artificial Intelligence is growing fast. New inventions are making day to day tasks simpler and it will probably be common in everyday life in the next generation, like computers. As a kid, I've always been facinated with AI and looked to online friends when I was lonely growing up as an only child. I often wonder how different life would be if my stillborn elder sister Amy was alive. As such, a longtime fantasy has been to develop an Artificial Machine for Youth (AMY), meaning an AI system that has emotional intelligence as well as logical. Most importantly would be the sense of duty and security of the eldest child. While I think it's cool, it does feel surreal that humanity is one step closer to that fictitious world dreamt in my teenager years.
